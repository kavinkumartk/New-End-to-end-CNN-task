## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective CNN architecture for image classification. The model is trained on the "flowers" dataset and predicts the class of a given flower image.

**Key features:**

Multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction

MaxPooling layers for downsampling

Fully connected layers with Dropout for classification

Early stopping to prevent overfitting

## ðŸ“ˆ Training vs Validation Accuracy

The plot represents the model performance across epochs:

- **Blue Line (Train Acc)** â†’ Training accuracy improvement as the model learns.
- **Orange Line (Val Acc)** â†’ Validation accuracy to monitor generalization performance.

![Model Accuracy](c202082f-e295-49eb-a64e-aa7012b6db68.png)

### Observations:
1. Training accuracy starts around **40%** and gradually improves to **80%**.
2. Validation accuracy starts around **50%** and stabilizes near **74%**.
3. After ~15 epochs, training accuracy continues to increase, but validation accuracy plateaus, indicating **possible overfitting**.
